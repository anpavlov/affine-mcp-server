# Tool Reference

`tool-manifest.json` is the source of truth for the canonical tool names exposed by this server.

Use this document as a grouped catalog. For exact schemas, your MCP client should inspect `tools/list`.

## Conventions

- Canonical names only: legacy alias names are not part of the public tool surface
- Document editing relies on AFFiNE WebSocket-backed operations where noted
- Experimental organize tools are marked explicitly
- Use `AFFINE_TOOL_PROFILE=read_only`, `core`, or `authoring` in production if you want a reduced surface
- Invalid profile, group, and tool names stop startup; the server never falls back to a broader surface

Handler failures are normalized into an MCP error result with `isError: true`,
`ok: false`, a stable `code`, `retryable`, and `recoveryGuidance`. Authentication
or network classification may also appear as `causeCode` when it differs from
the primary code. SDK-level input or schema validation can remain a native
protocol error. Use the returned fields to decide whether to inspect, correct,
or retry an operation; do not infer success from human-readable error text.

## Workspace

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_workspaces` | List all available workspaces | Includes best-effort profile names, avatar references, and direct URLs; set `includeProfile: false` for a faster GraphQL-only response |
| `get_workspace` | Read workspace details | Includes permissions plus best-effort profile metadata and a direct URL |
| `create_workspace` | Create a workspace with an initial document | Destructive in the sense that it creates new server state |
| `update_workspace` | Update workspace settings | Requires at least one of `public` or `enableAi`; use carefully in shared workspaces |
| `delete_workspace` | Permanently delete a workspace | Destructive; `confirmWorkspaceId` must exactly match `id`; unconfirmed outcomes return an MCP error instead of a success receipt |
| `list_workspace_tree` | Return the workspace document hierarchy as a tree | Useful before moving docs; depth is limited to 0-20 |
| `get_orphan_docs` | Find documents that are not linked from a parent doc | Useful for cleanup and audits |

`list_workspaces` and `get_workspace` add `name`, `avatar`, `url`, and `profileStatus` to the existing GraphQL fields. `profileStatus` is `available`, `unavailable`, or `skipped`. Profile loading is best effort, so a realtime metadata failure leaves the GraphQL workspace visible with nullable profile fields. The `avatar` value is AFFiNE's stored avatar reference and is not guaranteed to be an external URL.

Document metadata tools that load the workspace-root snapshot distinguish an
unavailable root from an empty one. `workspace_root_unavailable` means the root
snapshot could not be loaded or confirmed; it must not be presented as a
workspace with zero documents. An empty workspace is reported only after the
root is loaded successfully and contains no document entries. This code does not
describe the best-effort profile loading used by `list_workspaces` or
`get_workspace` above. Check `recoveryGuidance` and `affine-mcp doctor` before
trying again.

`create_workspace` creates the server workspace first and then synchronizes its
initial document. A partial result keeps `ok: true` because the workspace exists
and includes `workspaceId`, `firstDocId`, `status`/`syncStatus: "partial"`, and
`requiresManualRepair: true` when the follow-up sync is unconfirmed. Treat the
IDs as durable recovery handles: call `read_doc` with that workspace and
`firstDocId` first, because the timed-out sync may still complete, then repair
the existing document if needed. The message and `recoveryGuidance` state that
no automatic retry is scheduled; callers must not issue a second
`create_workspace` request that could produce a duplicate workspace.

Generated `url` fields are browser links built from the configured AFFiNE base
URL. `AFFINE_GRAPHQL_PATH` changes the API endpoint only; it is not appended to
workspace or document links. For a custom route, keep the deployment base in
`AFFINE_BASE_URL` and set the route separately, for example
`AFFINE_GRAPHQL_PATH=/api/graphql`.

## Organization

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_collections` | List workspace collections | |
| `get_collection` | Read a collection by id | |
| `create_collection` | Create a collection | |
| `update_collection` | Rename a collection | |
| `update_collection_rules` | Replace a collection's rules and rebuild its allow-list from workspace docs | Useful for rule-backed collections |
| `delete_collection` | Delete a collection | Destructive |
| `add_doc_to_collection` | Add a document to a collection allow-list | |
| `remove_doc_from_collection` | Remove a document from a collection allow-list | |
| `list_organize_nodes` | Dump the organize or folder tree | Experimental |
| `create_folder` | Create a root or nested folder | Experimental |
| `create_workspace_blueprint` | Create a simple workspace folder blueprint | Good for structured onboarding setups |
| `rename_folder` | Rename a folder | Experimental |
| `update_folder_icon` | Set or clear a folder's sidebar icon (emoji, or named icon with optional color) | Experimental. See [Sidebar icons](#sidebar-icons) |
| `get_folder_icon` | Read a folder's current sidebar icon | Experimental |
| `delete_folder` | Delete a folder recursively | Experimental and destructive |
| `move_organize_node` | Move a folder or link node | Experimental |
| `add_organize_link` | Add a doc, tag, or collection link under a folder | Experimental |
| `delete_organize_link` | Delete a doc, tag, or collection link | Experimental and destructive |

Collection rules accept `title` with `contains`, `equals`, or `startsWith`; `tag` with `contains` or `equals`; and `docId` with `equals` or `in`. All values are trimmed nonblank strings, except `docId` with `in`, which requires a nonempty list of nonblank strings. Invalid combinations reject the entire request before changing membership; they are never silently dropped from a submitted rule set.

## Documents

### Discovery and metadata

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_docs` | List documents with pagination | Includes `node.tags` |
| `list_tags` | List all tags in a workspace | |
| `search_docs` | Search titles with substring, prefix, or exact matching | Supports tag filter, updatedAt sorting, and zero-based `offset`; limit is 1-200 |
| `find_doc_by_title` | Find documents whose title exactly matches a supplied title | Supports optional case-insensitive matching and a result limit |
| `list_docs_by_tag` | List documents with a specific tag | |
| `get_doc` | Read document metadata | |
| `read_doc` | Read block content and plain text snapshot | WebSocket-backed; block rows include formatting-preserving `deltas`, hierarchy-derived `parentId` values, and `linkedDocIds` for inline LinkedPage references |
| `get_capabilities` | Inspect the server's high-level authoring and fidelity capabilities | Useful for adaptive clients |
| `analyze_doc_fidelity` | Analyze how a document maps to Markdown and which native AFFiNE structures are lossy | Good before export or migration |
| `list_children` | List direct child docs linked from a document | |

`search_docs` uses zero-based `offset` pagination over the matching metadata
entries. Its response includes `offset`, `limit`, `totalCount`, `hasMore`,
`truncated`, and `nextOffset` alongside `results`:

- `hasMore` is true when another matching page remains after the returned rows.
- `truncated` is true when the requested `limit` capped the current response;
  it is a signal to continue with `nextOffset`, not an indication that results
  were lost.
- `nextOffset` is the next offset to request when more rows remain and is null
  when the page is complete.

Continue while `hasMore` is true. An empty `results` array is not by itself a
failure or proof that the workspace has no documents; check `totalCount` and
`nextOffset` as well.

`get_capabilities` separates what the server supports from what this process
currently exposes. `server.supportedTools` is the full implemented tool list;
`server.effective.profile` and `server.effective.enabledTools` describe the
surface after `AFFINE_TOOL_PROFILE`, disabled groups/tools, and any auth-mode
policy are applied. A capability can therefore be supported while its related
tool is absent from `tools/list`; use `tools/list` as the final callable-surface
check.

### Publish and visibility

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `publish_doc` | Make a document public | |
| `revoke_doc` | Revoke public access | |

### Create, duplicate, and move

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create_doc` | Create a new document | `content` is stored as one plain paragraph; accepts `folderId` for immediate organize-folder placement |
| `create_doc_from_markdown` | Create a document from Markdown content | Creates native blocks, accepts `folderId` for immediate organize-folder placement, and converts `[label](LinkedPage:<docId>)` links to native inline linked-doc references |
| `inspect_template_structure` | Inspect a template's native AFFiNE structure and native-clone support | Helps choose a clone strategy |
| `instantiate_template_native` | Instantiate a template via native AFFiNE block cloning, with optional Markdown fallback | Higher-fidelity than Markdown-only cloning |
| `move_doc` | Move a document in the sidebar by relinking it under another parent | Validates resources and cycles, adds the destination first, avoids duplicate links, and reports partial source-removal failures |
| `trash_doc` | Move a document to the AFFiNE trash | Recoverable with `restore_doc`; preserves document content and is safe to retry |
| `restore_doc` | Restore a document from the AFFiNE trash | Preserves document content and is safe to retry |
| `delete_doc` | Delete a document | WebSocket-backed and destructive; `confirmDocId` must exactly match `docId`, and metadata removal plus acknowledged or verified content deletion are reported separately |

Use `create_doc_from_markdown` when the initial content contains headings, lists,
links, quotes, tables, or code fences. `create_doc.content` does not parse Markdown;
when structured Markdown is detected, its receipt warns that the content was
stored as one plain paragraph.

### Content editing

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `update_doc_title` | Rename a document in workspace metadata and in the page block | |
| `update_doc_icon` | Set or clear a document's sidebar icon (emoji, or named icon with optional color) | See [Sidebar icons](#sidebar-icons) |
| `get_doc_icon` | Read a document's current sidebar icon | |
| `append_block` | Append canonical block types with validation and placement control | Inline-rich-text block content accepts a plain string or formatting-preserving delta array. Also supports media, embeds, database, and edgeless blocks. `frame`/`edgeless_text`/`note` accept `x`/`y`/`width`/`height`. `note` with `text` auto-creates a child paragraph. Bookmarks allow canonical web, mail, telephone, `affine://blob/<key>`, and `affine://doc/<id>` URLs; iframes require HTTP(S); provider embeds require HTTPS URLs on official hosts. URL validation does not make an outbound server fetch. Image and attachment `sourceId` values are exact opaque keys returned by `upload_blob`, including keys containing spaces or path separators. |
| `update_block` | Partially update an existing text block without changing its id | `text` accepts a plain string or formatting-preserving delta array. Also supports todo checked state, list style, and same-flavour paragraph/heading/quote conversions. Cross-flavour conversions are rejected because AFFiNE replaces the block id. |
| `update_table_cell` | Replace one cell in an existing AFFiNE table | Uses zero-based row/column coordinates, preserves arbitrary inline attributes, and keeps the first row bold. Plain-text updates preserve existing cell formatting when the text is unchanged. |
| `update_table_column_widths` | Set every column width in an existing AFFiNE table | Widths follow current column order. Values are 60–4096 px; `null` restores AFFiNE's automatic width. `read_doc` returns `tableColumnWidths` for exact readback and rollback. |
| `move_block` | Move or reorder an existing block without changing its id | Reuses `append_block` placement (`parentId`, `beforeBlockId`, `afterBlockId`, or `index`) and rejects root moves and cycles. |
| `create_semantic_page` | Create an AFFiNE-native page with an intentional section skeleton and native block composition | High-level authoring helper |
| `append_semantic_section` | Append a semantic section to an existing page by heading title | High-level authoring helper |
| `append_markdown` | Append Markdown content to an existing document | |
| `replace_doc_with_markdown` | Replace the main note content with Markdown | Destructive; requires `full` with the `destructive` group enabled. Applies the replacement as an all-or-nothing local batch; empty output requires `allowEmpty: true` |

Document creation initializes the page's workspace `updatedDate`, and successful content edits advance it after the document write is acknowledged. This keeps AFFiNE's Updated lists and sorting in sync with MCP writes. If content is saved but the timestamp update cannot be confirmed, the tool returns `workspace_page_updated_date_failed` with `retryable: false`; inspect the saved document and repair its metadata rather than repeating the content edit.

#### Document creation failures

Document content and workspace metadata are persisted separately. Creation tools (`create_doc`, `create_doc_from_markdown`, `create_semantic_page`, and `instantiate_template_native`) reconcile failed writes using the same generated document ID and check existing metadata before retrying registration.

If completion still cannot be confirmed, the tool returns `isError: true`, `ok: false`, the allocated `workspaceId` and `docId`, the failed `stage`, and `recoveryGuidance`. `contentPersisted` and `metadataPersisted` are `true`, `false`, or `null` when read-back was unavailable. `DOCUMENT_CREATE_PARTIAL` identifies persisted content with missing workspace metadata; `DOCUMENT_CREATE_UNCERTAIN` identifies an unconfirmed outcome. For Markdown or native-template materialization failures, `contentPersisted: null` means the requested content is unconfirmed even though the document shell may already exist. These responses set `retryable: false`: inspect the returned document ID and reconcile its metadata before issuing another creation request, which would allocate a different ID.

For `list_docs`, pagination follows the backend page even when deleted entries are filtered out. An empty visible page can still have `hasNextPage: true`; continue with its `endCursor` instead of treating an empty `edges` array as the end of the workspace.

### Reviewed document patches

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prepare_doc_patch` | Prepare text replacement, block insertion, and subtree deletion as one immutable update | Returns the complete server-generated structural diff and expiry time; never writes to AFFiNE |
| `apply_doc_patch` | Apply a reviewed patch by `patchId` | Destructive; rejects stale, expired, discarded, consumed, busy, and delivery-unknown patches |
| `discard_doc_patch` | Discard a prepared patch | Process-local, credential-scoped, and idempotent; never writes to AFFiNE |

Patch inputs are strict. `prepare_doc_patch.operations` accepts `replace_block_text`, `insert_block`, and `delete_block_subtree` (1–100 operations). Inserted blocks are limited to paragraph, quote, heading, list, and code blocks under an existing note, paragraph, or list. Patches expire after 30 minutes. They survive MCP session changes within one server process when the AFFiNE endpoint and backend credentials are identical, but are lost on server restart and are not shared between replicas. Credential changes require preparing a new patch. Authorized callers using the same backend service credentials share this scope; it is not per-ChatGPT-user isolation. The 100-record and 32 MiB store limits apply across all sessions and credential scopes. The public diff covers every document block and represents binary values only as byte length plus a full SHA-256 digest; it never exposes the prepared Yjs update.

#### Formatting-preserving block text

For inline-rich-text blocks, `append_block.text`, `update_block.text`, and `update_table_cell.text` accept either a string or a delta array. Each delta requires a string `insert` and may contain arbitrary `attributes`; the server passes attributes through without restricting them to a fixed formatting vocabulary.

```json
[
  { "insert": "plain " },
  { "insert": "colored", "attributes": { "color": "var(--affine-text-highlight-foreground-blue)" } },
  { "insert": " highlighted", "attributes": { "background": "var(--affine-text-highlight-yellow)" } }
]
```

`read_doc` block rows and block snapshots returned by editing tools include both flattened `text` and formatting-preserving `deltas`; table rows additionally include the full `tableData` matrix and `tableCellDeltas`. Markdown export still reports and drops inline attributes it cannot represent; use `deltas` for lossless block-level read/modify/write flows.

Inline page references use `{ "insert": " ", "attributes": { "reference": { "type": "LinkedPage", "pageId": "<docId>" } } }`: one ASCII space per reference, with its label resolved by AFFiNE. Block, table-cell, and database rich-text writes reject visible reference labels and missing page IDs before saving. Exact legacy zero-width-space reference markers are normalized to native spaces when written; existing stored documents remain readable.

#### Sidebar icons

`update_doc_icon` and `update_folder_icon` accept an emoji or a named icon such as `{ "type": "affine-icon", "name": "FlagPanel", "color": "#EB4C42" }`. `name` must match an `@blocksuite/icons` export without the `Icon` suffix (for example `FlagPanel` for `FlagPanelIcon`); names are not validated, and unknown names render as no icon in AFFiNE. `color` is optional and accepts any CSS color.

### Tags

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create_tag` | Create a reusable workspace-level tag | |
| `add_tag_to_doc` | Attach a tag to a document | |
| `remove_tag_from_doc` | Detach a tag from a document | |
| `delete_tag` | Delete a workspace tag and detach it from every document | Destructive; accepts a tag id or name, rejects an ambiguous name |

### Custom properties

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_doc_properties` | List workspace custom-property definitions and a document's current values | WebSocket-backed; reads the `db$docProperties` / `db$docCustomPropertyInfo` sub-docs |
| `create_custom_property` | Create a workspace-wide custom property definition | Types: `text`, `number`, `checkbox`, `date`. Returns the `propertyId` |
| `delete_custom_property` | Soft-delete a custom property definition by id or name | Destructive; existing values are hidden |
| `set_doc_property` | Set a document's custom property value by property id or name | Value validated per type (`checkbox` boolean, `number`, `date` `YYYY-MM-DD`, `text`) |
| `clear_doc_property` | Remove a custom property value from a document | |

### Markdown export

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `export_doc_markdown` | Export document content as Markdown | Preserves supported inline rich text and safely escapes untrusted Markdown contexts, URLs, tables, code fences, and optional frontmatter |
| `export_with_fidelity_report` | Export a document with a machine-readable fidelity report | Reports unsupported inline attributes and native block loss while using the same safe serializer |

## Database blocks

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compose_database_from_intent` | Create or enrich a database block from a high-level schema intent | Useful for project boards and structured tables |
| `add_database_column` | Add a column to a database block | Supports `title`, `rich-text`, `select`, `multi-select`, `number`, `checkbox`, `link`, and `date`; rejects a title addition when the current snapshot already contains one |
| `add_database_row` | Add a row to a database block | Rich-text and title values accept strings or delta arrays |
| `delete_database_row` | Delete a row by row block id | Destructive |
| `read_database_columns` | Read schema metadata, types, options, and view mappings | Useful before edits |
| `read_database_cells` | Read row titles and decoded cell values | Rich-text titles and cells include plain values and formatting-preserving deltas |
| `update_database_row` | Update multiple cells on a row at once | Rich-text deltas are preserved; `createOption` defaults to `true` |

## Edgeless canvas and surface elements

AFFiNE's edgeless doc has two layers: top-level edgeless blocks (`note`, `frame`, `edgeless-text`) with `prop:xywh`, and the surface layer (`affine:surface`) which stores free-floating shapes, connectors, canvas text, and groups in `prop:elements.value` — the native BlockSuite representation.

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get_edgeless_canvas` | Read the full canvas: edgeless blocks + surface elements with parsed `{x,y,width,height}`, aggregate `bounds`, per-type `elementCounts` | Deterministic z-order (fractional-index sorted). Note entries carry a structured `children` array of their block descendants (`flavour`, `type`, `text`, `language`, `checked`) so markdown-seeded content round-trips faithfully. |
| `add_surface_element` | Add a `shape`, `connector`, `text`, or `group` to the surface | Shapes: rect/ellipse/diamond/triangle with fill, stroke, and text. Connectors accept `sourceId`/`targetId` and optional `sourcePosition`/`targetPosition` relative `[x,y]` in `[0,1]`. When both endpoints are bound by id and neither position is supplied, they auto-snap to BlockSuite's four tangent-carrying side-midpoints based on relative bounds. Creates the surface block if the doc doesn't have one. |
| `list_surface_elements` | List all surface elements (optionally filter by `type` or `elementId`) | Returns raw `xywh` plus parsed `bounds` sorted by fractional `index` ascending; serializes `Y.Text` fields to plain strings. |
| `update_surface_element` | Partially update an element by id | `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` merge with current `xywh` (move without resizing, or vice versa). `text`/`label`/`title` replace their `Y.Text` wholesale. Fields not applicable to the element's type come back in the response `ignored` list. |
| `delete_surface_element` | Delete an element by id | `pruneConnectors: true` additionally removes any connectors referencing the deleted element. |
| `update_frame_children` | Replace a frame block's contents wholesale | Every resolved id (surface element or edgeless block) goes into `prop:childElementIds` and comes back in `ownedIds`; unknown ids in `missing`. Default `resizeToFit: true` recomputes xywh to match new contents + `padding` + title band; pass `resizeToFit: false` to preserve the current box. Pass `[]` to clear ownership (resize skipped). |
| `update_edgeless_block` | Partially update a note/frame/edgeless-text block | `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` merge with current `prop:xywh`; `background` replaces `prop:background`. Fields not applicable to the flavour come back under `ignored`. Use for repositioning / resizing / recoloring without re-creating the block. |
| `delete_block` | Delete a block by id | Returns the deleted root and descendant snapshots so callers can reconstruct content. Removes descendants and unlinks from the parent's `sys:children` by default. `deleteChildren: false` keeps descendants orphaned; `pruneConnectors: true` also drops surface connectors referencing any deleted id. Refuses `affine:page`. |

### Layout helpers on `append_block`

When the new block is a frame/note/edgeless_text on the canvas, `append_block` accepts three optional fields that compute coordinates from the current doc state instead of the caller doing arithmetic:

| Field | Applies to | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `markdown` | `type="note"` | Parse markdown into heading/paragraph/list/code child blocks inside the note. Height auto-estimated from the content when `height` is omitted. |
| `childElementIds: [id, ...]` | `type="frame"` | The frame's contents. Accepts ids of surface elements (shapes/connectors/groups) AND edgeless blocks (notes/frames/edgeless-text) — every resolved id goes into `prop:childElementIds`, matching what BlockSuite's editor writes when you drag members into a frame. Dragging the frame drags every owned member. Unresolved ids come back under `missing`. If `width`/`height` are omitted, the frame is sized to the union of resolvable bounds + `padding` + a 30px title band. |
| `stackAfter: { blockId, direction?, gap? }` | any canvas block | Position relative to one or more existing siblings. `blockId` may be an array — picks whichever ref is furthest in the stack direction (useful when stacking below a row of columns) and centers the new block on the union bounds' orthogonal axis (when widths match, same as inheriting the anchor's x). Caller-provided `x` / `y` on the orthogonal axis still wins. Default `gap` is direction-aware: **80px horizontal** (left/right), **40px vertical** (up/down) — mirrors native-flowchart spacing where the flow axis gets more breathing room. |
| `padding` | used by `childElementIds` auto-sizing and as fallback `gap` for `stackAfter` | Default 40. Explicit `padding` on the block overrides the direction-aware default; explicit `stackAfter.gap` wins over both. |

## Comments

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_comments` | List comments on a document | |
| `create_comment` | Create a comment on a document | |
| `update_comment` | Update comment content | |
| `delete_comment` | Delete a comment | Destructive |
| `resolve_comment` | Resolve or unresolve a comment | |

## Version History

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_histories` | List document history timestamps | |
| `read_doc_revision` | Read one historical document snapshot | Uses the same block projection as `read_doc`; requires an ISO timestamp with timezone |
| `diff_doc_revision` | Compare a revision with another revision or current state | Uses the same authoritative structural diff as reviewed patches; binary values are fingerprints |

## Users and authentication

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `current_user` | Return the current signed-in user | |
| `sign_in` | Sign in with email and password | Self-hosted flows only for direct programmatic sign-in |
| `update_profile` | Update current user profile data | Requires at least one of `name` or `avatarUrl` |
| `update_settings` | Update user notification preferences | |

## Notifications

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_notifications` | List one page of notifications for the current user | Returns a stable envelope with notification cursors, server page info, explicit counts, and filter scope |
| `read_all_notifications` | Ask AFFiNE to mark notifications as read | Check `applied` and `status`; false or failed outcomes return MCP errors with stable codes |

`list_notifications` accepts either zero-based `offset` pagination or an `after` cursor, never both. `first` is limited to 1-100, offsets must fit a GraphQL signed integer, and cursors must contain 1-2,048 characters. The response uses these fields:

- `notifications`: notification nodes from this page, each with its GraphQL edge `cursor`
- `pagination.pageInfo`: unmodified server `hasNextPage` and `endCursor` values
- `counts.serverTotalCount`: the server's total notification count before local filtering
- `counts.serverUnreadTotalCount`: always `null` because this endpoint does not provide a global unread total
- `counts.fetchedPageCount`, `unreadOnFetchedPageCount`, and `returnedCount`: explicit page-level counts
- `filter.scope`: `fetched_page` when `unreadOnly=true`, otherwise `none`

`unreadOnly` is intentionally a client-side filter over the fetched server page. It does not rewrite `serverTotalCount` or `pageInfo`; continue pagination to inspect unread notifications beyond the current page.

## Blob storage

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `upload_blob` | Upload a file or blob to workspace storage | Defaults to `encoding: "utf8"`; pass `encoding: "base64"` explicitly for binary content. The returned opaque key is accepted as image/attachment `sourceId`; it is not an external URL |
| `delete_blob` | Delete a blob from workspace storage | Permanent deletion requires `confirmKey` to exactly match `key`; false, exception, and unconfirmed outcomes return stable MCP errors |
| `cleanup_blobs` | Permanently remove deleted blobs | `confirmWorkspaceId` must exactly match `workspaceId`; false, exception, and unconfirmed outcomes return stable MCP errors |

## Native mindmaps

See the [native mindmap guide](native-mindmaps.md) for request/response fields,
an executable workflow example, validation behavior, and deployment links.

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create_mindmap` | Create a native mindmap root in an existing document | Returns `mindmapId` and `rootId`; default style ONE |
| `get_mindmap` | Read validated topology, child order, labels, collapsed state and geometry | Discover IDs with `get_edgeless_canvas` |
| `add_mindmap_node` | Append or insert a child of `parentId` | `beforeId` must be a sibling; returns `nodeId` |
| `update_mindmap_node` | Replace text or change collapsed state | Keeps IDs and parent links |
| `reparent_mindmap_node` | Move a node and its descendants within the same map | Rejects root moves, cycles and foreign IDs |
| `set_mindmap_layout` | Persist direction and node coordinates together | `right`, `left`, `balance`; no `down`/`up` |
| `set_mindmap_style` | Apply native style and persist node appearance/size | `style`: integer 1–4; keeps hierarchy |
| `set_mindmap_lock` | Set native map lock inherited by its nodes | `locked`: boolean; retains independent node/ancestor locks |

These operations store a native `type=mindmap` element with a `Y.Map` of shape IDs
and `{index, parent?, collapsed?}` details. They do not create ordinary connectors;
BlockSuite derives its own local connectors from the hierarchy. Shape nodes only,
maximum 500 nodes and depth 64. Node removal is deliberately not exposed.

Layout values are verified against [AFFiNE 174ad9bc5](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/blob/174ad9bc5/blocksuite/affine/model/src/consts/mindmap.ts):
RIGHT=0, LEFT=1, BALANCE=2. Downward layout requires an editor change, not a new MCP
enum value. Positions are persisted because remote changes do not trigger every
local editor watcher. Text dimensions are estimated; the native editor may refine
them when opened. The root remains anchored during layout and reparenting.

Styles ONE=1, TWO=2, THREE=3, FOUR=4 are supported by `set_mindmap_style` and
the optional creation `style` (default ONE). `set_mindmap_lock` writes native
`lockedBySelf`; effective `locked` also includes containing group locks. Other
mutations reject locked maps/nodes. Unlock keeps independent node locks intact.

Create a document with its intended `folderId` first and verify its sidebar link,
then create a root, add project children to `rootId`, and add tasks to the returned
project `nodeId`. One shared MCP server serializes hierarchy mutations per
workspace. Document writes accept optional `expectedRevision` from `read_doc`
to reject stale content before mutation. The upstream persistence API has no
compare-and-swap: independent server processes or native editors can still race;
read back the map after a batch. See [concurrent writes](configuration-and-deployment.md#concurrent-writes).
A failed push may have an uncertain outcome,
so inspect the document before retrying creation. Existing malformed or shared
node ownership is rejected before persistence.
