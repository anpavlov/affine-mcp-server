# Workflow Recipes

## Destructive confirmations

Permanent destructive tools require callers to repeat the target identifier so a stale or incorrectly selected resource cannot be deleted accidentally:

- `delete_doc`: pass `confirmDocId` equal to `docId`
- `delete_workspace`: pass `confirmWorkspaceId` equal to `id`
- `delete_blob` with `permanently: true`: pass `confirmKey` equal to `key`
- `cleanup_blobs`: pass `confirmWorkspaceId` equal to `workspaceId`

Read or list the target immediately before deletion and never reuse a confirmation value for a different resource.

Prefer `trash_doc` for ordinary cleanup because it is recoverable with `restore_doc`. Use `delete_doc` only when permanent deletion is explicitly required.

This guide shows practical tool sequences for common AFFiNE workflows.

The exact JSON schema for each tool is discoverable from MCP `tools/list`. The recipes below focus on tool selection and ordering.

## 1. Discover the right workspace and document

Use when:

- you are connecting to an AFFiNE instance for the first time
- you need to locate a document before editing it

Typical tool sequence:

1. `list_workspaces`
2. `list_docs` or `search_docs`
3. `get_doc` or `read_doc`

Prompt example:

> List my workspaces, find the document titled "Launch Plan", and show me its current structure before editing anything.

## 2. Create a document and place it in the sidebar tree

Use when:

- you need a new document under an existing parent doc
- you want the new page to be visible in the workspace tree immediately

Typical tool sequence:

1. `search_docs` to find the parent
2. `create_doc` or `create_doc_from_markdown`
3. `move_doc` if you created the doc before deciding its final parent
4. `list_children` to verify placement

Prompt example:

> Create a document called "Q2 Notes" under "Team Wiki", then verify that it appears as a child page.

## 3. Find documents by tag or title and clean up metadata

Use when:

- titles are inconsistent
- tags exist but you are not sure which document to open

Typical tool sequence:

1. `list_tags`
2. `list_docs_by_tag` or `search_docs` with `tag`
3. `update_doc_title`
4. `add_tag_to_doc` or `remove_tag_from_doc`

Prompt example:

> Show me documents related to onboarding, rename the outdated title, and make sure the page has the `Onboarding` tag.

## 4. Append content or replace the main note

Use when:

- you need to add content incrementally
- you already have Markdown content to import

Typical tool sequence:

1. `read_doc`
2. `append_block` or `append_markdown`
3. `replace_doc_with_markdown` only when you intend to overwrite the main note

Prompt example:

> Read the current document, append a short release checklist section, and leave the existing content intact.

## 5. Work with database blocks

Use when:

- you want to inspect or update an AFFiNE database
- you need to add rows or change schema

Typical tool sequence:

1. `read_doc` to inspect the page structure
2. `read_database_columns` to inspect schema
3. `add_database_column` if needed
4. `add_database_row`
5. `update_database_row`
6. `read_database_cells` to verify

Prompt example:

> Inspect the task database on this page, add a `Due Date` column if it is missing, then add a new task row and verify the final values.

## 6. Review comments and resolve them

Use when:

- you need to triage feedback on a document
- you want to update or resolve comments after an edit

Typical tool sequence:

1. `list_comments`
2. `create_comment` or `update_comment`
3. `resolve_comment`

Prompt example:

> List unresolved comments on the document, summarize them, and resolve the ones that are already addressed in the current draft.

## 7. Publish a document or revoke public access

Use when:

- you are moving a document from draft to public view
- you need to remove public access after review

Typical tool sequence:

1. `get_doc`
2. `publish_doc` or `revoke_doc`
3. `get_doc` again to confirm visibility state

Prompt example:

> Publish the final release notes page and confirm that public access is enabled.

## 8. Export, duplicate, or clean up linked structure

Use when:

- you need a markdown backup
- you want to recreate a page from Markdown
- you need to inspect linked child pages

Typical tool sequence:

1. `export_doc_markdown`
2. `create_doc_from_markdown` if you need a Markdown-based copy
3. `list_children` if you need structural context

Prompt example:

> Export the template page as Markdown, create a copy under the current parent, and verify the copied page's child links.

## 9. Review a document patch before writing

Use when a human must approve the exact document-block changes before they are sent to AFFiNE.

Typical tool sequence:

1. Call `prepare_doc_patch` with the target document and operations.
2. Show the target workspace/document and the complete server-generated `diff` to the user.
3. Stop and wait for explicit approval. Do not treat the request to prepare as approval to apply.
4. On approval, call `apply_doc_patch` with exactly the returned `patchId`; otherwise call `discard_doc_patch`.
5. If apply reports stale, unknown delivery, expiry, or a missing patch, read the document again and prepare a new patch for a new review.

Never reconstruct and replay previously approved operations after a stale/unknown/missing-patch result. Prepared patches are shared across MCP sessions in one server process for identical AFFiNE endpoint and backend credentials. They expire after 30 minutes and are lost on server restart; multiple replicas do not share them. Changing backend credentials requires a new prepare. Patches intentionally provide no strict compare-and-swap guarantee for a concurrent edit that lands between the final stale check and the push.

To inspect older content, use `list_histories`, then `read_doc_revision` or `diff_doc_revision`. History reads do not fall back to the current document when a revision is missing or malformed.
